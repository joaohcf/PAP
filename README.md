# Prova de AptidÃ£o Profissional (PAP)

This project was made during my final year at school in 2019.

I made a website and software focused in motocycling equipment. The website was for customers to see equipment available in the store and the application was made for staff to managed stock, orders, etc.

FOR NOW, this repo only has the website!

## Test it yourself!

You can test the website by composing with docker

`docker compose up -d`

then go to

`localhost:80`

## Functionalities

- Product search
- Shopping cart
- Favorites products
- Email system

### Email system (PHPMailer)

If you want to test the email system, just put an email account credentials in `website/.env` file. Keep in mind that some things may be missing (like the website logo) because this is not deployed in a real server.

Email features:

- Forget password
- Purchase information
- Ordering information

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- PHP
- MySQL
